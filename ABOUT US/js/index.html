                        <p><em>Center For Application Development (CAD)

Centre for Apps Developement (CAD)
CAD is an essence of technical and other curriculam activities which revolves round the betterment of students, conducted by enthusiastic students of NITD family. It actually bridges the gap between the knowledge and implementations of the application development module which is a major aspect of real world.</em></p>
                        <p>Objective : CAD mainly focusses on Apps development as ultimately a software product offers more power of earning, because we develop once and then implement or install everywhere. We should definitely start to think in this direction and start building both educational and entrepreneurial capacity. CAD's goal comprises having the next best Operating System or an Office Productivity Suite or a Programming Language IDE, etc. CAD works on the communication, presentation and management skills of the people associated with it. CAD allows everyone to get update with the recent activities in IT market regarding software development, technical upgradation and related issuses. CAD welcomes new talents with their technical knowledge, art work or any other sort of self representary quality, so that one can get a platform to prove himself/herself.</p>
                      <p>
                      <h1>CAD ACTIVITIE
</h1>
                      <h1>1. TECH-TALK :</h1>
                      Tech-Talk is a regular activity of CAD group, where a finite group of learners sit together irrespective of their branches and streams to learn, discuss, state & discover something fruitful from a topic. In todays world, knowledge from book is not enough to face the real competition but it requires a lot of confidence, updation with the changes going on, and one should know the edge of particulars. With this conception, CAD invites all NIT family members for talk sessions weekly. Characterstics: Weakly Talk Sessions. Spreading knowledge from crash to the dome. Open for all to have a talk on discoverable topics. Improves communication and presentation skills. Bridges communication gap between different branches of NITD tree.
<p>
<h1> 2. SOFTWARE CELL :</h1>
 Software cell is the real time activity of CAD. With this activity, CAD encourages people to stand forth not only to prove but also improve themselves regarding the most necessary development process of IT world. Here people sit together or in modules to develop different real life applications and softwares which can help them in future for their career prospective and in the other way decreasing their resistivity in the field of development. CAD not only help the campus student for the purpose but also widens the name of NITD in outside world. Through use of a famous social networking channel, CAD runs an online open group called “MCA_TECH-TALK”. Initially this group comprised of a handful of members but gradually more and more people joined this group in order to share and gain knowledge. It thus proved to be a significant tool to sharpen the cognitive processes of the CAD members. At present this group holds approx 1800 members from different colleges and institutes of the nation within a small timespan of 365 days.
 </p> <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
 <h1>3. TECHNOSHINE :</h1>
 Under the Annual activity, CAD successfully laid its impression on NITD family by its first app-based Tech-Fest conducted in Oct. 2011 i.e “Technoshine X.1”. CAD gathered all the talent from PG galaxy (MCA, MBA, M-Tech.) of NITD in this vary fest and created an ambiance of knowledge, teamwork, creativity & explorablity which was self describing by its tag line “Act Out of Your Age...” . CAD cares for whole tree so it conducted all diverse events in this fest for all the students of NITD with a motto “Say no to Paper” as every event was based on applications run on desktops or laptops. It was a 2 day nonstop technotainment fest which simply addressed some technical events like Code-War, Trick-Tracer, Techno-Quest etc. And some amusing and fun events like Rising star, Holly-Bolly along with a Gaming event called Knock-Out (Counterstrike). CAD also linked this fest to outer world by conducting an online event i.e. Artificial Intelligence, which got a very nice response from all over NIT's and other colleges of India.

This is the only tech-fest which mainly focuses on “SAY NO TO PAPER” since all the events are app-based. The CAD group that handles this fest did its finest work to make Technoshine X.1 and Technoshine X.2, a triumph. Technoshine X.1,X.2 and X.3 made a very good impression on the NIT, DGP students. Last two editions of Technoshine consisted many Technical events like Artificial Intelligence, Code war, Trick Tracer, etc., General events Holly-Bolly, Performer of the Year, etc., Workshop on Android and a Gaming event Counter Strike.</p>

     <p> This year CAD is again ready with full zeal and excitement to present its Fourth edition with many new striking Technical events on coding , algorithm and social causes like Code Zip , Total Chaos and Inspire India,Just Click , General events like Tattoo Making ,Brain Marathon  etc., Gaming event Counter Strike, Quiz events like Quiz etc., and most awaited events like " NET HUNT " and " Performer Of The Year " in TECHNOSHINE X.4.The three days non-stop Techno-tainment is here to amuse you. So, just take a break from the daily college routine, join the venture and enhance your assessment.</p>
